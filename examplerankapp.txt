About when did you join DarCraft?

November 3rd, 2011

About how many hours do you play DarCraft a week?

15 hours a week.

How old are you?

16

Why do you think you deserve the rank you are applying for?

Since I have been playing on DarCraft for quite a while, I know exactly how the server runs. I know the correct ban length for each offense, when to warn someone, and how everything works. Each and every day I strive to be a valuable member on DarCraft by helping players out with whatever they need, and I feel that by becoming a staff member I can take that to the next level.

Do you play on other servers? If so, which ones?

No, I currently do not play on any servers daily. Occasionally I will hop on a minigame server with friends to play a quick game, but I am in no way dedicated to any server other than DarCraft.

Have you had experience being a Staff Member before? If so, on which server(s) and game(s)? What plugins and commands are you familiar with?

Yes, I am currently an Administrator on a Trouble in Terrorist Town server under the name of GenesisBeta. http://forums.uegservers.com/ I also used to be an Administrator on a defunct Minecraft server, Tartarus. I am familiar with simple commands such as /tempban , /co i, /warn, /kick, and all essential moderating commands.

Have you donated to DarCraft? If so, what is your current rank and how much have you donated?

Unfortunately, I have not donated to DarCraft as of now. I am strongly considering it, and am currently saving up my change for VIP or Darcraftian.

What time zone do you live in?

I live in in the Mountain Standard Time Zone (MST), but I live in Arizona, so I do not observe Daylight Savings Time.

Explain how you could be a help to DarCraft.

Being over 16 years old, I feel that I am a very responsible person. I am also quite good at solving problems, and am able to keep calm during stressful situations. I am also able to be on DarCraft 2-6 hours a day, depending on the day of the week and other factors. I am very respected throughout the community, by staff members, the owner, and almost all of the members.
If I recieve this rank, I will be able to relieve some of the stress off of the owner by solving problems quickly and easily. I will do my best to solve any problem thrown at me, and if I am unable to solve it, I will take it to the Administrators. I can also moderate the forums on the website when needed, which can also help out the server greatly. I will do whatever I can to help make DarCraft a better place.

How do you stand out from other players applying for staff?

I stand out from other players applying due to the fact that I have been an active member on DarCraft for over 2 years, and I will continue to be a valued and dedicated member until either DarCraft shuts down, or I lose interest in Minecraft. I do not see either of those happening any time soon, especially if I end up recieving this rank.

Is there anything else that we should know, or anything that you would like to say?

I would like to thank the staff on this server for being able to maintain such a smooth and stable server, and I hope to have the opportunity to join the staff team some day!

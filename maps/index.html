                <h4>So you're interested in creating a FreezeTag map?</h4>
                <p>That's awesome! As you can probably tell from the FreezeTag servers, we are lacking some quality maps. We are constantly accepting and looking to expand our map selection for players to choose from, but unfortunately we lack the builders to constantly create new maps. That's why we are allowing maps from everyone!</p><br>
                
                <h5><b>We are now only allowing players personally accepted by DaRr3n911 to build FreezeTag maps. If you are interested, and are an exceptional builder, please contact DaRr3n911.</b></h5><br>
                
                <h4>Map Requirements:</h4>
                <p>If you choose to submit a FreezeTag map, your map must contain all of the following:</p>
                <p> - A perfectly sized map for 16 players.<br>
                	- No hard to reach places such as on top of trees that require parkouring to reach.<br>
                	- A very detailed, clean map that is not messy and very well built.<br>
                	- A small map download size, preferably under ~20 MB<br>
                	- Should be "floating" in air to minimize lag for players.<br>
                	- No secret places, ways out of the map, or anything of the sort. Just the playable map, and nothing else.<br>
                	- Availability to change your map for us for whatever reason if needed.<br>
                    - No abrupt endings to the island. Make it very natural.<br>
                    - No random builds in your map. Your map should follow a theme of some sort, and should stay to true to it throughout the entire map.<br>
                    - Make sure the map is as good of quality as our current maps are. If it isn't something that you would see on DarCraft's official builds, such as spawns and minigame maps, then do not submit it.<br>
                    - No special game mechanics. For example, you can't have portals that teleport players or special regions that give effects.<br>
                    - It must be a balanced map that gives both the Chosen One and the Thawed players an equal chance of winning.<br>
                    - Minimal parkour. If your are going to add parkour, make it easy.<br>
                    - Redstone devices are not allowed under any circumstance. Especially not redstone clocks. Any redstone related items must be purely asthetic and must not be functional. Example: using buttons for a sculpture's eyes is okay. Creating a blinking light system or a command block teleporter is absolutely not allowed.<br>
                    - You must use an original theme that is nothing like our current maps. You want your map to be original, and something that people will want to play.<br>

                <h4>Map Submission:</h4>
                <p>Once you complete your FreezeTag map, contact DaRr3n911 or x128 to talk about how to give us your map.</p>
                
                <h4>Frequently Asked Questions:</h4>
                <p>Below is a list of the most frequently asked questions and the answers to them.</p>
                
                <h5>Where do I build my map?</h5>
                <p>While we prefer that you build your tag map in the Freebuild world of the Survival/Creative Server, you can pretty much build your map anywhere you choose as long as you have access to the world file. Do not build your map on a server you do not own and do not ask us to host a server for you to build on. If you really want a private server to build your map, you can rent one for a couple bucks a month from a hosting provider.</p>
                
                <h5>What do I get in return?</h5>
                <p>Assuming your map gets accepted by Darren and x128, your map will be added to the FreezeTag server for everyone to play and enjoy. Your names will also be displayed when the map gets voted for. If your map is especially good, you may receive some Tokens on the game network.</p>
                
                <h5>I have a question</h5>
                <p>We'd be happy to answer it! You can ask either Darren or x128 the next time you see either of us in-game, or ask another staff member to pass along the message to one of us.</p>
                
                <h5><b>Please note that your submission may not be accepted, so please do not be upset if it is not. Thank you for supporting DarCraft and the FreezeTag Community!</b></p>

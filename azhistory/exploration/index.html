        <p>The first documented exploration of Arizona was in 1539 by Frenchman <b>Marcos de Niza</b>, followed by Spaniard <b>Francisco VÃ¡squez de Coronado</b> in 1540. </p>
        <p>Explorers brought European knowledge to Arizona, dramatically changing the culture and lifestyle of the Native Americans.</p>
        <p>After the Europeans began to have a greater influence on the Western Hemisphere, Native Americans were affected quite drastically. </p>
        <p>Through trade, Native Americans were able to acquire new crops to plant and take advantage of, along with animals such as horses to help them in travel and hunting.</p>
        <p>The Native Americans were able to learn a lot from the Europeans as well. They learned about language, religion, culture, mathematics, and more.</p>
        <p>While they benefitted from European Influence, they were negatively impacted as well. Disease was brought to the Americas, causing a very large majority of Native Americans to die, as they were not prepared for the outbreak.</p>

        <p>Many Native Americans were also very upset with European influence. The rise in deaths following European arrival and the mistreatment by the American Colonists caused many tribes to rebel against Europeans. While they fought hard, they were almost completely unsuccessful in being respected like they wanted by Europeans.</p>
        <p>Luckily, in the future, the United States Government finally began to recognize the mistreatment of Native Americans, giving them designated Native American Reservations to live on and more rights and respect in the country.</p>
        <p>Arizona has one of the largest Native American populations out of all 50 states, as well as having a huge portion of land designated for Reservations. Reservations in Arizona are home to tribes such as the Navajos and Apaches.</p>
        <p>The majority of Reservations are in Northern Arizona, in relative isolation from the populous cities such as Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff.</p>

      <p>There are many Native American groups throughout Arizona's history. Some of the more famous ones not talked about are the <b>Navajo</b> and <b>Apache</b> people.</p>
      <p>The Navajo people, believed to have migrated from far north, lived in the northeastern corner of the state as well as the northwestern corner of New Mexico. Before meeting the Pueblos and Spanish, the Navajos relied heavily on a nomadic lifestyle. </p>
      <p>The Apache group classifies culturally related Native Americans across the United States. This group of people, while mostly originating from New Mexico and the area around northeastern Arizona, live all over the country today. </p>
      <p>The group relied mostly on a nomadic lifestyle, relying on whatever they could to be successful.</p>
      <p>Many different Native American groups have been living in Arizona for thousands of years, managing to thrive in conditions that aren't as promising as other areas of North America.</p>

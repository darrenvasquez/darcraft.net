        <p>Arizona was first claimed by Mexico as part of the state of Sonora in 1822. The land had a relatively low population, and even lower Mexican population.</p>
        <p>Following the <b>Mexican-American War</b> in 1848, the <b>Mexican Cession of 1848</b> gave the United States a large portion of the state, but not all of it.</p>
        <p>Due to the Government's desire to establish a railroad through current-day Arizona, the Government bought the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.</p>
        <p>The New Mexico Territory, which was the name of the land occupied in areas of what is today known as Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, was formed in 1850.</p>
        <p>Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Arizona was declared part of the Confederacy, forming the <b>Confederate Territory of Arizona</b>.</p>
        <p>This territory was short lived, as Union troops captured the territory less than a year later and returned it back to the New Mexico Territory.</p>
        <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Arizona was a largely agricultural state, relying almost completely on farming and mining.</p>

        <p>Talks of the Arizona Territory becoming a state began to get serious in the 1920s. In hopes to maintain control in the U.S. Senate, the Republican Party suggested that the territory join the state of New Mexico, but it was shot down due to being too controversial.</p>
        <p><b>Progressives</b> in Arizona wanted to become a state so that they could lead the country in woman's suffrage, direct election of senators and more.</p>
        <p>The Territory of Arizona submitted their constitution to Congress in 1912, and it was approved by President Taft on <b>February 14th, 1912</b>. This allowed Arizona to become the 48th state of the United States of America, and the last of the Contiguous United States.</p>
        <p>The newly formed state paved way for new success in the future, through tourism, farming, mining, transportation, and new residents looking for a warmer climate to live in.</p>

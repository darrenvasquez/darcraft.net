      <p>Native Americans have lived in America for an estimated 10,000 years, making their history quite extensive.</p>
      <p>The earliest people in the area were nomadic hunters, who over time began to settle in basic pit houses, turning more and more to agriculture as their technology developed.</p>
        <p>The earliest known groups of people were known as the <b>Anasazi</b> and <b>Sinagua</b>. The Anasazi people lived near the northeastern tip of the state, while the Sinagua people lived inbetween current-day Flagstaff and Phoenix.</p>
        <p>Until around 1,000 years ago, both groups weren't very advanced. About 1,000 years ago, they began to construct communities, usually into cliff dwellings and wherever the living conditions worked best.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the two groups of people abandoned their land in the 12th and 13th centuries. While their reasoning is unknown, it is believed to be the result of a major drought that caused them to migrate away.</p>

              <p>The <b>Hopi</b> people were similar to the Anasazi and Sinagua people in that they abandoned their homes for unknown reasons in the 12th and 13th centuries. They migrated to other parts of Arizona, most likely to seek more resources and a better life.</p>
      <p>The Hopi people lived in villages with apartment-like complexes, and were called "Pueblos" by Spanish explorers. The group is known for being very spiritual through ceremonies and philosophical beliefs.</p>
        <p>They relied on farming foods such as corn, beans and squash to feed themselves, but also relied on nature for food.</p>
        <p>The Hopi people are still alive and well today, living on reservations across the state of Arizona.</p>

      <p>There are many Native American groups throughout Arizona's history. Some of the more famous ones not talked about are the <b>Navajo</b> and <b>Apache</b> people.</p>
      <p>The Navajo people, believed to have migrated from far north, lived in the northeastern corner of the state as well as the northwestern corner of New Mexico. Before meeting the Pueblos and Spanish, the Navajos relied heavily on a nomadic lifestyle. </p>
      <p>The Apache group classifies culturally related Native Americans across the United States. This group of people, while mostly originating from New Mexico and the area around northeastern Arizona, live all over the country today. </p>
      <p>The group relied mostly on a nomadic lifestyle, relying on whatever they could to be successful.</p>
      <p>Many different Native American groups have been living in Arizona for thousands of years, managing to thrive in conditions that aren't as promising as other areas of North America.</p>

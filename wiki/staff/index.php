            <p>DarCraft isn't possible without staff members. They help keep the server running by maintaining the website, the plugins, the server software and the players. This page highlights some of the most important staff and a bit of information on what they do.</p>
            <h3>DaRr3n911</h3>
            <p>Darren, also known as DaRr3n911 in game, is the Owner of DarCraft. He established the server back in November of 2011 and continues to play a vital role in the success of the server. He makes all of the important decisions on the server and continues to do whatever he can to ensure that the players are happy and that nothing goes wrong.</p>
            <h3>SirBumpington</h3>
            <p>Bump, also known as SirBumpington in game, played a vital role in the early success of DarCraft. Upon the decision to open the server to the public in 2011, he helped set up the plugins for the server and create spawns for the server. Without his help, DarCraft wouldn't have been able to succeed. While he isn't as active anymore, he is currently the Co-Owner of the server.</p>
            <h3>x128</h3>
            <p>x128 is the Developer for DarCraft. x128 has allowed DarCraft to transition from being hosted by an inefficient game hosting provider to being hosted by a dedicated server company, which allows for more customizability and freedom to create things such as the forum software and this page. Along with that, he has created many of the custom plugins that DarCraft uses everyday, such as DarTime, DarParty, DarChest, DarWarp, xInventories and more. </p>
